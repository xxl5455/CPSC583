# Optimizing GNN Performance with Random Forest Feature Selection

## Overview

This repository focuses on optimizing Graph Neural Network (GNN) performance by integrating Random Forest for feature selection. The project explores how leveraging feature selection techniques can improve GNN models' efficiency and accuracy in document classification tasks.

## Key Features

Feature Selection: Utilizes Random Forest to identify the most important features before GNN processing.

Baseline Models: Implements Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and GraphSAGE as baseline GNN models.

Performance Comparison: Evaluates the impact of feature selection on training metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Dataset Support: Supports datasets like Cora and CiteSeer for document classification tasks.
